    <h1><u>Work Portfolio</u></h1>
    <p>Below are Three examples from my various projects, 2 being academic and the other one being a personal project.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Web Design Lab in Multimedia Web Development Class</h2>
    <p>A project that was taught during the Web Design Classes at Douglas. In it, we chose resolutions for current desktops, tablets and smartphones and made 3 different layouts that change with the size of the screen.</p>

    <h2>Building a GUI-based app in Visual Studio using C#</h2>

    <h2>Creating an Arkanoid-style game using C# and Unity Engine</h2>
    <p>I took a Udemy course for personal interest of learning game development. The course is called Complete C# Unity Developer 2D. It teaches how to make space-shooters, tower-defense and other types of games using a free game engine called Unity, alongside its built-in code library using C# in Visual Studio. You can play the game I made below if you're viewing this site on a desktop. (WARNING: HAS SOUND)</p>
